pimpam-kata
===========

An extended version of the FizzBuzz kata. Used in my TDD workshop.

How to use it?
==============

Simple download it or browse the code online.

The main idea is to explore the commit history to see how the detailed design emerges from the first simple tests to the last ones.

I recomend to start from the first commit and see how the code evolves with each test/refactor cycle.
